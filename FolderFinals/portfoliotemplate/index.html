					<h3>Highschool Graduate</h3>

					<h4>Benguet National High School</h4>
					<p>Ah, high school, a time filled with laughter, friendships, and unforgettable moments. During my high school days, I had a knack for finding myself in amusing situations that brought joy to my classmates and teachers alike.
					One memorable incident occurred during a school talent show. I decided to showcase my hidden talent for impersonations. With spot-on impressions of famous celebrities, teachers, and even our school principal, the entire auditorium erupted in laughter. It was a moment that brought the entire school community together, sharing in the joy of laughter and good-natured humor.
					Another hilarious moment happened during a school trip. As we embarked on a nature hike, I somehow managed to stumble into a patch of mud, leaving me completely covered from head to toe. Instead of getting embarrassed, I embraced the situation and turned it into a mud-themed fashion statement. My classmates couldn't help but join in, and soon we were all laughing and enjoying the unexpected turn of events.
					Of course, high school wouldn't be complete without the occasional prank. One April Fool's Day, I teamed up with a group of mischievous friends to execute an elaborate prank on our teachers. We filled the staff room with balloons, covered their desks in sticky notes, and even managed to sneak a rubber chicken into the principal's office. The reactions from our teachers ranged from shock to laughter, and it became a legendary prank that was talked about for years to come.
					These are just a few of the many humorous moments that made my high school experience truly unforgettable. It was a time of laughter, camaraderie, and creating memories that we still laugh about to this day.</p>
